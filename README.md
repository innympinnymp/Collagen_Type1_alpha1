# Collagen_Type1_alpha1
This program was written to explore an important biomaterial, Collagen Type 1 alpha-1 chain. Collagen Type 1 is one of the most abundant proteins in human's body and provides structural support for the cells. Its application is seen in various industries such as cosmetics, food, biotech research, and biomedical. Currently, most commonly used Collagen Type 1 are extracted from human, bovine, and porcine. However, as Collagen Type 1 is used to biomedical treatment, concerns about infectious diseases that associated with bovine and porcine were arised. Alternative sources from fish such as Oreochromis niloticus were explored. However, as we want to focus on cancer treatment application of Collagen Type 1,  we tried to capture the physico-chemical properties during the interaction and the binding sequences between cell-material interaction.
